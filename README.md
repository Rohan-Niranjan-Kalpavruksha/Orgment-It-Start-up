Orgment It-Start-up

An app that allows the user to augment 3D organs onto 2D textbooks images to help students understand the unique human anatomy better !!!!
Our mission, with the help of ORGment It, is to impart such visualisation and the concept of realism in the domain of biology, which is affordable and highly user efficient. Such a visualization when coupled with augmented reality makes this application highly powerful and user friendly. 
Our application is built to increase the understanding of students about biomedical organs and enhance peer-to-peer knowledge by efficiently presenting it to the masses in a better format by making use of our detailed AR models.
